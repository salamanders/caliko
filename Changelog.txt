1.4.0 (2020/07/17)
- Fixed the Mat3f.createRotationMatrix() method to correctly handle the singularity on the positive Y-axis (thanks, meaten!)
- Also added a (commented out) Pixar version which works, but generates slightly different orthogonal 3x3 matrices (see method for details)

1.3.7 (2020/04/02)
- Updated documentation to discuss potential Mac demo crash & potential mitigation steps
- Updated documentation display of project file structure

1.3.6 (2019/06/27)
- Updated Java version from 8 to 11 (we could use 12, but 11 is LTS so let's go with that).
- Updated LWJGL3 version from 3.0.0b to 3.2.2 and made necessary changes to maven POMs & Caliko demo.
- Updated maven plugin versions used & JUnit plugin, hence...
- ...much maven pom rework.
- Changed marshalling/unmarshalling to not rely on @XmlAttributes (deprecated in Java 9), using serialization now.
- Many, many updates to the JavaDoc to comply with Java 8+ stricter syntax.
- Updates / fixes / clarifications to user documentation.

1.3.5 (2018/10/28)
- Added functions to get the global pitch & yaw of vectors or bones to the respective Vec3f and FabrikBone3D classes.
- Modified Mat3f createRotationMatrix method to use a technique that results in less roll / 'spin' of the bones.
- Updated user docs to mention said pitch & yaw values.

1.2
- [MAJOR] Added embedded targets for 2D/3D chains so that chains in the same structure do not have to all use/be-solved-for the same target location.
  By enabling embedded target mode for a chain, when it's time to solve it the embedded target is used rather than any provided target. See
  the user documentation and 2D demo 7 and 3D demo 12 for worked examples.
- All calls to "updateTarget" are now "solveForTarget", and there are additional "setEmbeddedTargetMode" and "updateEmbeddedTarget" methods for chains.
- Made FabrikBone2D default constructor public [FabrikBone2D]
- Fix for crash when solving chain with a single bone (2D and 3D) [FabrikChain3D]

1.1.2
- Moved utils package from au.edu.federation.caliko.utils to au.edu.federation.utils as the classes within are generic
- Modified source to import new Vec/Mat classes
- Added performance metrics test (source code in perf-test folder)
- Updated user documentation with details of the above.
